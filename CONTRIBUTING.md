# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to our project on Github. These are mostly guidelines, not rules.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Code of Conduct.  By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to project moderators.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[testing]"
```

4. Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff**: For code formatting and linting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: To automate style checks
- **Type hints**: Required for all function parameters and return values

The project's code style is automatically enforced by pre-commit hooks. You can manually run the checks:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Pull Requests

Please follow these guidelines when submitting pull requests (PRs):

- PRs should be manageable in size to make it easy for us to validate and integrate
- Each PR should be contained to a single fix or a single feature
- Describe the motivation for the PR
- Describe a methodology to test and validate, if appropriate

Please ensure that the code in your PR follows a style similar to that of the project.  If you find a material discrepancy between the style followed by the project and a de facto standard style given the project language and framework, please let us know so we can amend and make our code more maintainable.

## Testing

We use `pytest` for testing. Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
tox

# Run specific test environments
tox -e default
tox -e docs
```

## Asking Questions

Prior to asking questions, please review:

- Closed issues
- Wiki pages
- SDK documentation

If your question isn't answered in these resources, please file an issue! This helps us improve our documentation.
